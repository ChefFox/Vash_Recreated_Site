    Together, we will explore – enquire with curiosity – what is going on for you. You will not have to explain anything perfectly or have anything figured out.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is just beginning. And you have done one of the hardest bits already because you are here. You have begun.
   </p>
   <p>
    **How?** Well, we will talk. I will teach you how to be present with breathing mindfully.
   </p>
   <p>
    There will be times for silence while you connect deeply with your body – by tuning in and listening to it and your heart.
   </p>
   <p>
    Heart Embodied Healing is about greeting those memories, feeling them, experiencing them, talking them out – and in doing so, it creates space to be more authentically you.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sorrow will have meaning. The parts of you that you might not like about yourself will make sense (it is called your shadow). All will become so much clearer as we explore and feel.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shame will have a voice; it will soften, be understood, and your heart’s story will be told. In doing this, you create space for love. Love for yourself but love for others and love for life. It is truly magical. I know, I have been doing it and continue every day to do so.
   </p>
   <p>
    Together, we will get to the root of what is deep in your heart. In doing so, you grow towards the sky. Branches will extend to that light. Blossom will be followed by a canopy, and you will be able to breathe the air that you, like a tree, helped to clean.
   </p>
   <p>
    You will meet other trees – like-minded souls/people – and things will change. It is truly magical.
   </p>
   <p>
    Contact me for more details, and we can start growing your tree.
