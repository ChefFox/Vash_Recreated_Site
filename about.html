    Thank you for visiting Vashtihealing.

    <strong>
     My background is rooted in psychotherapy, and I have been training to be a True Essence Practioner TM.
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    **My heart and I have been on a huge journey.** I was born with a hole in my heart, and I have faced quite a few things over the years! My heart held a lot of memories, and each one that I have greeted (and continue to greet) has given my heart space and colour.
   </p>
   <p>
    In fact, I was asked to write down what my experience and journey of opening my heart up to healing felt like, and this is part of what I wrote:
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     “My black, damaged heart was turning to colour, piece by piece, memory by memory. I likened my heart to a piece of Japanese pottery that had broken and was being pieced back together with gold, silver, and platinum – making it more precious, loved, adored and valuable than it was before it broke. Kintsugi. That is what my healing heart feels like now.”
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    To get to this, I greeted each memory as it landed (still does): sadness, grief, hurt, trauma, shame, my shadow – and in doing so, I am living/being my authentic self (my true essence TM).
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     My heart is open and full of love because it has space now, and I want you to feel that too: love for yourself, love for others, love for the world even!
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    And why trees for my background? Well, I love them – even my little grandson hugs trees, and when I am not with him!
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     I think a tree and its growth represent your journey to me and the work we will do together.
    </strong>
